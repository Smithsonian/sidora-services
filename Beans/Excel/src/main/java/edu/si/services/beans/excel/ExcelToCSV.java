/**
 * Converts an Excel spreadsheet (workbook) into a CSV. This class makes the following assumptions;
 * <list>
 * <li>1. Where the Excel workbook contains more that one worksheet, then a single
 *    CSV file will contain the data from all of the worksheets.</li>
 * <li>2. The data matrix contained in the CSV file will be square. This means that
 *    the number of fields in each record of the CSV file will match the number
 *    of cells in the longest row found in the Excel workbook. Any short records
 *    will be 'padded' with empty fields - an empty field is represented in the
 *    the CSV file in this way - ,,.</li>
 * <li>3. Empty fields will represent missing cells.</li>
 * <li>4. A record consisting of empty fields will be used to represent an empty row
 *    in the Excel workbook.</li>
 * </list>
 * Therefore, if the worksheet looked like this;
 *
 * <pre>
 *  ___________________________________________
 *     |       |       |       |       |       |
 *     |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |   E   |
 *  ___|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|
 *     |       |       |       |       |       |
 *   1 |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |
 *  ___|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|
 *     |       |       |       |       |       |
 *   2 |       |       |       |       |       |
 *  ___|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|
 *     |       |       |       |       |       |
 *   3 |       |   A   |       |   B   |       |
 *  ___|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|
 *     |       |       |       |       |       |
 *   4 |       |       |       |       |   Z   |
 *  ___|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|
 *     |       |       |       |       |       |
 *   5 | 1,400 |       |  250  |       |       |
 *  ___|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then, the resulting CSV file will contain the following lines (records);
 * <pre>
 * 1,2,3,4,5
 * ,,,,
 * ,A,,B,
 * ,,,,Z
 * "1,400",,250,,
 * </pre><p>
 * Typically, the comma is used to separate each of the fields that, together,
 * constitute a single record or line within the CSV file. This is not however
 * a hard and fast rule and so this class allows the user to determine which
 * character is used as the field separator and assumes the comma if none other
 * is specified.
 * </p><p>
 * If a field contains the separator then it will be escaped. If the file should
 * obey Excel's CSV formatting rules, then the field will be surrounded with
 * speech marks while if it should obey UNIX conventions, each occurrence of
 * the separator will be preceded by the backslash character.
 * </p><p>
 * If a field contains an end of line (EOL) character then it too will be
 * escaped. If the file should obey Excel's CSV formatting rules then the field
 * will again be surrounded by speech marks. On the other hand, if the file
 * should follow UNIX conventions then a single backslash will precede the
 * EOL character. There is no single applicable standard for UNIX and some
 * appications replace the CR with \r and the LF with \n but this class will
 * not do so.
 * </p><p>
 * If the field contains double quotes then that character will be escaped. It
 * seems as though UNIX does not define a standard for this while Excel does.
 * Should the CSV file have to obey Excel's formatting rules then the speech
 * mark character will be escaped with a second set of speech marks. Finally, an
 * enclosing set of speach marks will also surround the entire field. Thus, if
 * the following line of text appeared in a cell - "Hello" he said - it would
 * look like this when converted into a field within a CSV file - """Hello"" he
 * said".
 * </p><p>
 * Finally, it is worth noting that talk of CSV 'standards' is really slightly
 * misleading as there is no such thing. It may well be that the code in this
 * class has to be modified to produce files to suit a specific application
 * or requirement.

    /**
     * Checks to see whether the field - which consists of the formatted
     * contents of an Excel worksheet cell encapsulated within a String - contains
     * any embedded characters that must be escaped. The method is able to
     * comply with either Excel's or UNIX formatting conventions in the
     * following manner;
     *
     * With regard to UNIX conventions, if the field contains any embedded
     * field separator or EOL characters they will each be escaped by prefixing
     * a leading backspace character. These are the only changes that have yet
     * emerged following some research as being required.
     *
     * Excel has other embedded character escaping requirements, some that emerged
     * from empirical testing, other through research. Firstly, with regards to
     * any embedded speech marks ("), each occurrence should be escaped with
     * another speech mark and the whole field then surrounded with speech marks.
     * Thus if a field holds <em>"Hello" he said</em> then it should be modified
     * to appear as <em>"""Hello"" he said"</em>. Furthermore, if the field
     * contains either embedded separator or EOL characters, it should also
     * be surrounded with speech marks. As a result <em>1,400</em> would become
     * <em>"1,400"</em> assuming that the comma is the required field separator.
     * This has one consequence in, if a field contains embedded speech marks
     * and embedded separator characters, checks for both are not required as the
     * additional set of speech marks that should be placed around ay field
     * containing embedded speech marks will also account for the embedded
     * separator.
     *
     * It is worth making one further note with regard to embedded EOL
     * characters. If the data in a worksheet is exported as a CSV file using
     * Excel itself, then the field will be surrounded with speech marks. If the
     * resulting CSV file is then re-imports into another worksheet, the EOL
     * character will result in the original single field occupying more than
     * one cell. This same 'feature' is replicated in this classes behavior.
     *
